# Apple 1 NodeJS Emulator

NodeJS Apple 1 Emulator, include initial abstraction of 6820 and other core components.

Start in dev mode via: `npm run raw_start` or `yarn run raw_start`

You can compile it via webpack using: `npm run build` and just `npm start` to run the compiled version. This will not give you so much - just playing with the flow as it may be used to be consumed in a browser.

Project was build to sketch the hybrid HW version published here: https://github.com/stid/APPLE-1-ReplicaDue
